This project provides a foundational framework for further development. The included Proteus files (located in the MES folder) and Arduino code variations (designated by .ino file extensions) offer two functionalities: one utilizing a servo motor and another functioning without it. This versatility allows you to adapt the project to your specific needs and build upon it for more complex applications. Feel free to modify and expand upon this base to achieve your desired goals.
